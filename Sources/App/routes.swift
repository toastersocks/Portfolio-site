            I am passionate about serving and enabling people. Everyone has a story to tell and a unique perspective that can be learned from.
            I also enjoy software development and design for mobile platforms in my spare time. I'm interested in issues of accessibility/color blindness and dyslexia and how they affect and inform human-computer interaction. I'm also interested in culture and language/translation issues as pertaining to products and software.
            I enjoy thinking about ways in which computers can enhance our lives, rather than distract us.
